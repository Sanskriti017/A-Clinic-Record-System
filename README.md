# A-Clinic-Record-System
This is a web-application  project and its aim is to keep record of all the patients . This project made from HTML, CSS , JS (fronted) and Django (Backend).
we have seen such patient record system in hospital but not for a specific clinic . so, with this app the doctor running a clinic can keep a record of its all patients .
in this , the 3 options are given for user to download the data like text file, pdf and CSV file . so, that user can collect all the data in form of pdf on single page.
along with that with the help of csv file user can keep track of all record directly in MS-Word.
THE patient also have accessbility on this web app . the doctor and patint have its own id and password . the user have to first login to the web page and then can visit the site. the patient health is not in good condition  then patient can send a nortification to doctor if the patient feels unease and the doctor get nortified . 
After that , the doctor can dirctly contact to that person after being nortified as per his convenience. 
this create a good connection between doctor and patient .
