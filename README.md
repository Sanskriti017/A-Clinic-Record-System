# A-Clinic-Record-System
This is a web-application project and it aims to keep a record of all the patients. This project is made from HTML, CSS, JS (fronted), and Django (Backend). we have seen such a patient record system in hospitals but not in a specific clinic. so, with this app the doctor running a clinic can keep a record of its all patients . in this, the 3 options are given for the user to download the data like text file, pdf, and CSV file. so, that user can collect all the data in form of a pdf on a single page. Along with that with the help of CSV files users can keep track of all records directly in MS Word. The patient also has accessibility on this web app but the patient can access their record only whereas doctors have access to all patient records. The doctor and patient have their id and password. The user has to first log in to the web page and then can visit the site. if the patient's health is not in good condition then the patient can send a notification to the doctor if the patient feels unease and the doctor gets notified. After that, the doctor can directly contact  that person after being notified at his convenience. This creates a good connection between doctor and patient and helps the doctor to manage their patient records
